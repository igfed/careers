- Can we make the embedded youtube videos automatically go full screen when a user presses play?
	- the videos you linked are now brightcove; a quick scan indicates that this might be possible from
	javascript, but there seems to be no event to track when the player starts

- CTA for Ready for the Next Step for advisor should be a search function – identical to the CTA on http://investorsgroup.com/en/careers/become-a-financial-advisor (should only show RDs in the search results)
	- we had discussed this being a placeholder, with IG integrating the actual search tool

- In the modals for the section Our Edge, can the ‘Next’ links at the bottom right of the page be consistent in size and not block the content/copy
	- these are now a fixed width. These will not block content when a user scrolls to the bottom, but
	in order to avoid blocking entirely, a design change would be required (minimally, perhaps locating
	these near the top of the page)

- In the modals for the section Our Edge, clicking on the X to close the modal reloads the page.  Please ensure that it does not reload the page and the user should be in the section Our Edge
	- I can't replicate this; can you tell me the os/browser combo for this one?

- regarding spacing (pdf doc): we had discussed that precision would be left to inherited styles from the
	existing site; regardless, discrepencies above a few pixels were changed. There are a large amount of custom sizes in this layout.

	Also, some margins are variable due to the responsive layout; some cannot be changed, and some would require breaking the grid

- waiting on header; let me know if I should complete for the 28th.



Notice that the social sharing buttons have been removed and is replaced with a section/droplist in the Header for Share  - Steve has confirmed that this can be added to the scope and we can pay you more for it.  Please save this header to be your last task as our UI team may make a change to it.
